This is the implementation of my personal website

# Reflection
> What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you? 

The most challenging part for sure is adjusting the layout of elements. HTML is pretty easy to code up but writing CSS is a nightmare because some browser default formatting (margin around text) are pretty annoying.

>What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

I utlized `@media` property to adjust font size and text alignment when the screen is set to smaller size. Also I implemented flex/grid layout to make the webpage more responsive when screen size changes.

> What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

I tried to make the design more consistent across web pages therefore I created some generic classes. This greatly reduced the work in CSS because elements can share the identical formatting logic.

> Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 

I will add a better implementation of navigation bar in the mobile view, something like a drop-down menu.

> How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

10 hrs
